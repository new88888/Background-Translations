# Background-Translations

Repo is available for anyone that want to help translating [Background](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/background-beautiful-photos-from-unsplash/id1171036231?mt=8).



## Algorithm

1. Fork the repo.
2. Duplicate `generic.xliff` and name it as your language in ISO 639-1 norm.
3. Replace `generic` in `target-language="generic"` with your language.
4. Translate by updating `<target></target>` tags (delete it if you don't have anything to translate).
5. Make pull request with your changes.



## Helpers

Some  `<trans-unit>` tags have comments with name of the screenshot file, which can be helpful in translation.  





```xml
<!--
 //
        Info.plist
 //
 
 // 3D Touch
 UIApplicationShortcutItemTitleLatest = "Latest";
 UIApplicationShortcutItemTitleCurated = "Curated";
 UIApplicationShortcutItemTitleSearch = "Search";
 //
 //Photo Library permissions alert
 NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription = "Give Background Access to your Photo Library to save images.";
 -->
```



This should be translated too ðŸ˜š
